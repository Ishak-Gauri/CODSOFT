Task 1:
Predicting Movie Genres using NLP – An Awesome Introduction to Multi-Label Classification:

I was intrigued going through this amazing article on building a multi-label image classification model last week. The data scientist in me started exploring possibilities of transforming this idea into a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem.

That article showcases computer vision techniques to predict a movie’s genre. So I had to find a way to convert that problem statement into text-based data. Now, most NLP tutorials look at solving single-label classification challenges (when there’s only one label per observation).

But movies are not one-dimensional. One movie can span several genres. Now THAT is a challenge I love to embrace as a data scientist. I extracted a bunch of movie plot summaries and got down to work using this concept of multi-label classification. And the results, even using a simple model, are truly impressive.
